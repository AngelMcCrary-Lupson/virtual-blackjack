          <h1>BLACKJACK</h1>
          <p>
            Welcome to the game of Blackjack (aka 21)! Here are the basic rules of this
            version that you need to know to play.
          </p>
          <div>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>The goal of blackjack is to beat the dealer's hand without going over 21.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                Face cards are worth 10. Aces are worth 1 or 11, whichever makes a better hand.
                All others are their actual value.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                The player starts with two cards, the dealer's cards are hidden until the end.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                To 'Hit' is to ask for another card. To 'Stand' is to hold your total and
                end your turn.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                If you go over 21 you bust, and the dealer wins regardless of the dealer's hand.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                If you are dealt 21 from the start (Ace & 10), you've got a blackjack.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                Dealer will hit until his/her cards total 17 or higher.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>Doubling is not allowed. (don't worry if you don't know what this is)</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                You will always bet 5 credits to play each hand, and if you run out the game
                will end.
              </p>
            </li>
